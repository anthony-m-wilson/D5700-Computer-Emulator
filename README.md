# D5700
In this assignment you will build an emulator for a simple computer system that I invented called the D5700. Emulation is when you take a physical computer system and write software versions of the core hardware components. For example, RAM can be represented in software as a simple array of bytes, a CPU instruction is just a function that can be called, a register is just a variable. The idea of emulation is to take software written for a specific computer and be able to run it on another computer system with a different architecture.
